Note that by default, the tiddler's body ("text" field) is hidden. A card should be represented by as little text as possible to make it easier to use the board. BLC uses a field called "shorttext" as its default presentation which should only contain plain text. You can turn on display of the normal "text" field for reference to write the short presentation, or leave it on permanently if you like. If a tiddler does not contain "shorttext", it will display the title instead. BLC provides a view and edit area in the normal tiddler view and draft editing in the main story for convenient access there as well.

Any tiddler can be a board, even if it contains other text or wiki content. To create your own board, simply transclude the view template into any tiddler. If it tags others, they will show up as lists. You can also make a new empty board by pressing this button: {{$:/plugins/reidgould/blc/ui/buttons/new-board}} You can find it in the sidebar with the other controls.
